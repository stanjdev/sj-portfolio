            Started as a course project from a Harvard Web Development course called CS50W, I originally created this
            application with Python, Flask, and Jinja2 according to the course. I then remade it using the PERN stack
            (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, and Node.js). I used PostrgreSQL to store the users, books, and user reviews data.
            I set up Express.js for the GET, POST, PUT, DELETE CRUD capabilities for when the users leave reviews for
            individual books.
          </p>
          <p>
            One large challenge for this project was figuring out how to overcome some of React Router’s
            limitations when it came to dynamically pre-rendering pages when working with retrieved data.
            I had to figure out how to display the HTML template for the user reviews page first, before fetching
            the database and API data so that it can render that data onto the HTML page. I needed something
            that would work whenever the users refresh the page, navigate backwards and forwards, and type in the URL
            route directly to that specific book’s details page.
          </p>
          <p>
            In hindsight, I figured something like Gatsby or Next.js' getStaticProps for Static Generation would
            have been great for this, but I decided to test a few hypotheses with Express and found a workaround
            using the <code>res.sendFile()</code> response method to serve up the index.html file first, along with the necessary fetched
            data included in the <code>options</code> argument of the response. That way, the template HTML page is always served and
            rendered first in order for the data to be painted onto.

          <h2>Pre-rendering the "Details" HTML page first to display external fetched data</h2>
          <p>After deploying the production version to Heroku, when refreshing or GET requesting the 'details' page of
          any book (/details/9958 route for example), I was stuck with a plain, white screen with only a JSON object of the API
          response data for that book. My Express.js routes were catching all of the GET requests before React could load the index.html page,
          therefore the application had no webpage to display the API data onto.</p>
          <p>I wanted my HTML to be pre-rendered in order for the fetched GoodReads API and database data to successfully "hydrate" and display on the page.</p>
          <p> To remedy this, I found a work-around on my server-side using the Express.js <code><a href="https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.sendFile" target="_blank">res.sendFile(path, options)</a></code> method to pre-render
          the template index.html file as the <code>path</code> argument, along with the API response data object in the <code>options</code> argument.</p>
          {/*
          I needed to generate HTML for each page in advance, instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript.

          CSR SSR Static Page thing? Pre-rendering. Hydration
          This is because the app is not pre-rendered into static HTML

          In hindsight, I realized this problem of needing to fetch certain data to before loading and populating the HTML template page can be solved by using frameworks such as Next.js.

            Before finally deploying the application on Heroku for production, I installed the Heroku Postgres add-on to host the
            PostgreSQL database for my users, books, and reviews. I made sure to include the <code>DATABASE_URL</code> environment variable
            provided by Heroku to link to the app's <code>process.env</code> and used conditional boolean logic to select either "deployment" or "production"
            mode configuration.

          <p>This ensured the application was using either the "development mode" local database, or the "production mode" heroku hosted database.</p>
